Write a program to accomplish the following tasks:
Consider there are several files. The file name is defined as "SUBJECT_CODE.txt".
SUBJECT_CODE is a unique code used to represent a subject, for example, ICT701, ICT711, etc.
The contents in a file are typically as following:
Assignment 1 (20%) Assignment 2(20%) Final exam (60%) Student ID
8.20 13.81 45.20 s12334
14.50 18.40 74.50 s12323
12.50 13.00 65 .27 s43314
Each line represents marks for assignment 1 out of 20, assignment 2 out of 20 and final exam out of
100 for a specific student ID.
Each file contains the marks for a specified subject.
Write a program to load all files and process those files to get the average marks for assignment 1,
assignment 2 and final exam for each subject, and save the result into a file named
"SUBJECT_CODE_ave.txt".
You also need get the number of failed students in each subject assuming the passing mark is 50, and
