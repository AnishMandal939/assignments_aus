Create a function to search for a word entered by the user in a case-insensitive manner and count its
occurrences in the entire book.
Continuously ask the user to enter a word until they type "exit."
Display the final count of the entered word each time.
For example, if the user entered the word "what," the output should be:
Please enter a word to count occurrences of or "exit" to end: what
The word 'what' appears 44 times in this book
Please enter a word to count occurrences of or "exit" to end: exit
END!
